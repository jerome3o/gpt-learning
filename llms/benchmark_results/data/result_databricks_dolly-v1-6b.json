Hoping to gain knowledge of the artifact, the creature made a bargain with a wise talking animal who told him that he would grant his wish if he helped the animal pass his tests. When the tests were completed and the animal succeeded, the creature was given the chance to use the artifact, but soon realized that it was powerful and dangerous. To protect the creatures that lived in its path, he had to learn to use it and protect it as much as he could."
