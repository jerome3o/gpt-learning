This could be through the use of reusable straws, reducing the quantity of plastics used in foods such as cutlery and cups, or simply reducing the amount of plastic waste that gets thrown away. As an example, many companies have made commitments to be carbon neutral and one way they can do this is by reducing their carbon footprint through reusing plastic waste and reducing the amount of single use plastics used. \nAnother potential solution to the plastic pollution crisis could be the development of plastics that are not easily recyclable. This could include plastics that are waterproof, soluable, or even able to breakdown into smaller pieces, making it harder to recycle. The plastics industry is working on producing more functional plastics that could be used in a disposal only plastics, however it is not yet known if these types of plastics will be widely produced and used in the near future.\nThe final solution to the plastic pollution crisis could be the development of alternative plastics.

        "The ethical, safety, and privacy concerns surrounding the adoption of autonomous vehicles can be best addressed by developing and adhering to a common set of best practices across the industry. A key best practice would be to ensure that vehicles are always operated by a human driver when in autonomous mode, or that the vehicle is under direct human control or else is being monitored by a human driver. This framework would establish clear incentives for manufacturers to follow best practices and adequately disclose to consumers when autonomous modes are not being monitored or actively driven. Enforcement of this framework would be facilitated by creating a centralized database of vehicle telemetry information, accessible to both the insurance industry and the government, that would be required by all vehicles. This telemetry database could also serve to educate consumers on the specifications of their vehicles, including whether they are in autonomous mode or being actively monitored, and would therefore act as an important privacy protection mechanism."
