# Falcon 40B

I wanted to see what hardware I would need to run this model on-prem (if it was another RTX4090 I could be tempted)

I used [RunPods](https://www.runpod.io/console/pods) to hire some GPUs on demand for testing.

# 2x RTX4090s

Didn't work with 8bit quantisation (and 4bit looked far too slow on youtube videos to be useful)

# 3x RTX4090s
