    "# Building a Deep Neural Net for Sentiment Analysis on IMDb Reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Data collection and preprocessing\n",
    "- Collect a dataset of IMDb reviews\n",
    "- Preprocess the text data (tokenization, lowercasing, removing special characters, etc.)\n",
    "- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Model selection and architecture**\n",
    "- Research different types of deep learning models (**RNN**, LSTM, GRU, CNN, Transformer)\n",
    "- Decide on a model architecture\n",
    "- Experiment with pre-trained models (BERT, GPT, RoBERTa) for fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Model training and hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "- Set up a training loop\n",
    "- Use backpropagation to update the model's weights based on the loss function\n",
    "- Experiment with different hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, dropout rate, etc.) and optimization algorithms (Adam, RMSprop, etc.)\n",
    "- Monitor performance on the validation set during training\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Model evaluation and refinement\n",
    "- Evaluate the model on the test set using relevant metrics (accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, etc.)\n",
    "- Identify areas for improvement and iterate on the model architecture, training process, or preprocessing techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. \"Extra for experts\" ideas\n",
    "- Handle class imbalance (oversampling, undersampling, or SMOTE)\n",
    "- Experiment with different word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText) or contextual embeddings (ELMo, BERT)\n",
    "- Explore advanced model architectures (multi-head attention, capsule networks, memory-augmented networks)\n",
    "- Investigate transfer learning or multi-task learning\n",
    "- Conduct error analysis to understand and address specific issues\n",
    "- Develop a user interface or API for your sentiment analysis model"
